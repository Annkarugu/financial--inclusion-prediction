Project Description
The Financial Inclusion in Africa project aims to analyze demographic and financial service data from approximately 33,600 individuals across East Africa. The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account, promoting financial inclusion across the region.

Financial inclusion is critical for economic development, enabling individuals and businesses to access essential financial products and services, such as transactions, payments, savings, credit, and insurance, in a responsible and sustainable manner.

This project involves data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing, followed by the training of a machine learning classifier to accurately predict bank account ownership based on various demographic features. A user-friendly Streamlit application is created to allow users to input their data and receive predictions.

The findings from this project can contribute to understanding and enhancing financial services accessibility in East Africa, ultimately aiding policymakers and organizations in their efforts to promote financial inclusion.
